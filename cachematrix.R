## Here's an overall description of what these functions are doing:

## makeCacheMatrix Function:
## This function creates a special object (a list) that can store a matrix and its inverse.
## It initializes the matrix and inverse as NULL.
## It defines four methods within the list:
## set: Sets the matrix with a new value and resets the cached inverse to NULL.
## get: Retrieves the current matrix.
## setInverse: Sets the cached inverse of the matrix.
## getInverse: Retrieves the cached inverse of the matrix.

## cacheSolve Function:
## This function takes a "makeCacheMatrix" object as input.
## It attempts to retrieve the cached inverse from the object.
## If the cached inverse is found, it returns it, indicating that it's using cached data.
## If no cached inverse is found, it calculates the inverse of the matrix using the solve function.
## The calculated inverse is then set in the cache for future use, and the result is returned.




## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a list-like object that stores a matrix 
## and its inverse. It provides methods for setting and getting the matrix, as 
## well as setting and getting the matrix's inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## The cacheSolve function takes a 'makeCacheMatrix' object as input, retrieves 
## the stored matrix, and calculates its inverse. If the inverse has been 
## previously calculated and cached, it retrieves the cached result instead 
## of recalculating. This caching mechanism helps improve performance by 
## avoiding redundant computations.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return (m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  j <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(j)
  j
}
